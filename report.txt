In the provided code, the `results.txt` file contains the outcomes of experiments 
performed on binary search trees (BSTs) with various shapes. The trees are constructed 
using different combinations of shuffles and shakes, leading to distinct structures, 
heights, and average depths. When I analyze the tree outputs, I notice that the first configuration, 
which only involves shuffling the vector of integers 1000 times without shaking, results in 
moderately balanced trees. These trees have a height and average depth that are neither too low 
nor too high, and the number of comparisons required for find operations is moderate.

On the other hand, the second configuration, which combines 500 shuffles and 100 mild 
shakes with a maximum distance of 2, introduces some local structure to the vector. 
This causes the resulting trees to be less balanced than those in the first configuration, 
leading to slightly higher heights and average depths. As a result, find operations may 
require more comparisons on average.

Lastly, the third configuration, which involves 500 shuffles and 500 strong shakes with a 
maximum distance of 2, creates even more local structure in the vector, resulting in more 
unbalanced trees than the first two configurations. These trees have higher heights and 
average depths, and the number of comparisons required for find operations is higher on average.

By examining the `results.txt` file and comparing the metrics for each configuration, 
I can observe how different tree shapes impact the performance of BSTs in terms of height, 
average depth, and the number of comparisons needed for find operations. Generally, more balanced 
trees with lower heights and average depths require fewer comparisons for find operations, while 
more unbalanced trees with higher heights and average depths need more comparisons.
